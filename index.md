## [Intro to Data Science Projects](#intro-to-data-science-projects)
This section primarily includes projects from _Intro to Data Science_

### Data Sources and Project Ideas
Here are the data sources or project ideas that I would like to use for the Intro to Data Science final:
1. Deaths and their causes by state 2020-2023, rate of ER visits
2. Hospitalization, and death caused by traumatic brain injury
3. Provisional COVID-19 Deaths: Focus on Ages 0-18 Years
4. Foodborne illnesses at McDonald's
5. Sex by age by disability

## [Where's Schueller? Project](#wheres-schueller-project)
This section's purpose is to embed a **"live"** Plotly visualization in my page from your recent analysis of my geolocation data. I used mapbox and plotly to map Schueller's datapoints from Google Map data. 

- [**RQ 1**: Where did Professor Schueller live in Spain?](####**RQ-1**)
- [**RQ 2**: What is the farthest place Schueller traveled during his stay in Spain?](####**RQ-2**)
- [**A&B:** Heatmap](####**A&B**)


#### [**RQ 1**: Where did Professor Schueller live in Spain?](####**RQ-1**)

This map shows the geolocation data analysis results, including the likely home and farthest traveled point.

_You may see an insignificant blue screen... Please use the "+" and "-" sign on the top right to zoom out and in to view the data points plotted. This map is interactive_

#### [**RQ 2**: What is the farthest place Schueller traveled during his stay in Spain?](####**RQ-2**)

Here is the map of the farthest place Schueller traveled during his stay in Spain!. 

Farthest distance traveled: 9068.00 km
Coordinates of farthest point: (36.0743174, -115.1453751)

#### [**A&B:** Heatmap](####**A&B**)

##### [Geolocation Heatmap](#geolocation-heatmap)

The heatmap below explains and tracks a little bit more of Schueller's whereabouts during his stay in Spain. 
We can also see that Professor Schueller has spent some time in Florida (maybe flight?) and the east coast. I wonder if these parts are connecting flights. Also, we can see Professor Schueller's map counting times in the ocean! This is likely during a flight.

## [Above and Beyond](#above-and-beyond)

I'm including my heiarchal clustering assignment for flowers as a notebook.
