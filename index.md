This section primarily includes projects from _Intro to Data Science_

### Data Sources and Project Ideas
Here are the data sources or project ideas that I would like to use for the Intro to Data Science final:
1. Deaths and their causes by state 2020-2023, rate of ER visits
2. Hospitalization, and death caused by traumatic brain injury
3. Provisional COVID-19 Deaths: Focus on Ages 0-18 Years
4. Foodborne illnesses at McDonald's
5. Sex by age by disability

## [Where's Schueller? Project](#wheres-schueller-project)
This section's purpose is to embed a **"live"** Plotly visualization in my page from your recent analysis of my geolocation data.

- [**RQ 1**: Where did Professor Schueller live in Spain?](####**RQ-1**)
- [**RQ 2**: What is the farthest place Schueller traveled during his stay in Spain?](####**RQ-2**)
- [**A&B:** Heatmap](####**A&B**)


#### [**RQ 1**: Where did Professor Schueller live in Spain?](####**RQ-1**)

This map shows the geolocation data analysis results, including the likely home and farthest traveled point.
